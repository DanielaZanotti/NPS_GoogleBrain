# NPS_GoogleBrain - Ventilator Pressure Prediction


## Introduction
Our project stems from a Kaggle Competition organized by Google Brain where the dataset is composed by numerous time series of breaths produced using a ventilator connected to an artificial lung. The objective of this project is to predict the airway pressure in the respiratory circuit during the inspiratory phase of the breath, given the time series of control inputs and other auxiliary variables.
